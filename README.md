# Installation and Testing 🛠️ 

> For full setup instructions, see: [**Installation**](./docs/installation.md)

Before you can start building `websurfx`, you will need to have `Cargo` installed on your system. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

To get started with Websurfx, clone the repository, edit the config file, which is located in the `websurfx/` directory, and install the Redis server by following the instructions located [here](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) and then run the websurfx server and redis server using the following commands:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/neon-mmd/websurfx.git
cd websurfx
cargo build -r
redis-server --port 8082 &
./target/release/websurfx
```

Once you have started the server, open your preferred web browser and navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8080> to start using Websurfx.

> **Warning**
> Please be aware that the project is still in the testing phase and is not ready for production use.

# Multi-Language Support 🌍

> **Note**
> Currently, we do not support other languages, but in the future, we will start accepting contributions regarding language support because we believe that language should not be a barrier to entry.

# System Requirements 📊

At present, we only support x86_64 architecture systems, but we would love to have contributions that extend to other architectures as well.

# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) 🗨️

## Why Websurfx?

The primary purpose of the Websurfx project is to create a fast, secure, and privacy-focused meta-search engine. While there are numerous meta-search engines available, not all of them guarantee the security of their search engine, which is critical for maintaining privacy. Memory flaws, for example, can expose private or sensitive information, which is never a good thing. Also, there is the added problem of Spam, ads, and unorganic results which most engines don't have the full-proof answer to it till now but with Websurfx I finally put a full stop to this problem, also, Rust is used to write Websurfx, which ensures memory safety and removes such issues. Many meta-search engines also lack important features like advanced picture search, which is required by many graphic designers, content providers, and others. Websurfx attempts to improve the user experience by providing these and other features, such as proper NSFW blocking and Micro-apps or Quick results (like providing a calculator, currency exchanges, etc in the search results).

## Why AGPLv3?

Websurfx is distributed under the **AGPLv3** license to keep the source code open and transparent. This helps to keep malware, telemetry, and other dangerous programs out of the project. **AGPLv3** is a strong copyleft license that ensures the software's source code, including any modifications or improvements made to the code, remains open and available to everyone.

## Why Rust?

Rust was chosen as the programming language for Websurfx because of its memory safety features, which can help prevent vulnerabilities and make the codebase more secure. Rust is also faster than C++, which contributes to Websurfx's speed and responsiveness. Furthermore, the Rust ownership and borrowing system enables secure concurrency and thread safety in the program.
