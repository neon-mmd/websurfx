# Installation and Testing 🛠️

> For full setup instructions, see: [**Installation**]()

To get started with Websurfx, clone the repository, edit the config file which is located in the `websurfx`{.verbatim} directory and install redis server by following the instructions located [here](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) and then run the websurfx server and redis server using the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neon-mmd/websurfx.git
cd websurfx
cargo build
redis-server -p 8082 &
./target/debug/websurfx
```

If you want to use the rolling/edge branch, run the following commands instead:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neon-mmd/websurfx.git
cd websurfx
git checkout rolling
cargo build
redis-server -p 8082 &
./target/debug/websurfx
```

Once you have started the server, open your preferred web browser and navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8080> to start using Websurfx.

# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) 🗨️

## Why Websurfx?

The main goal of the Websurfx project is to provide a fast, secure, and privacy-focused [meta search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine). While there are many meta search engines available, they do not always guarantee the security of their search engine, which is essential for ensuring privacy. For example, memory vulnerabilities can leak private or sensitive information, which is never good. Websurfx is written in Rust, which guarantees memory safety and eliminates such problems. Many meta search engines also lack key features such as advanced image search, which is required by many graphic designers, content creators, and others. Websurfx aims to provide these features and others, such as proper NSFW blocking, to improve the user experience.

## Why AGPLv3?

Websurfx is released under the **AGPLv3** license to ensure that the source code remains open and transparent. This helps to prevent the inclusion of spyware, telemetry, or other malicious code in the project. **AGPLv3** is a strong copyleft license that ensures the source code of the software remains open and available to everyone, including any modifications or improvements made to the code.

## Why Rust?

Rust was chosen as the programming language for Websurfx due to its memory safety features, which can help prevent vulnerabilities and make the codebase more secure. Rust is also faster than C++, which helps to make Websurfx fast and responsive. In addition, Rust\'s ownership and borrowing system allows for safe concurrency and thread safety in the codebase.
