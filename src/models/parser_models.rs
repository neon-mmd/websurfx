//! This module provides public models for handling, storing and serializing parsed config file
//! options from config.lua by grouping them together.

/// A named struct which stores,deserializes, serializes and groups the parsed config file options
/// of theme and colorscheme names into the Style struct which derives the `Clone`, `Serialize`
/// and Deserialize traits where the `Clone` trait is derived for allowing the struct to be
/// cloned and passed to the server as a shared data between all routes except `/robots.txt` and
/// the `Serialize` trait has been derived for allowing the object to be serialized so that it
/// can be passed to handlebars template files and the `Deserialize` trait has been derived in
/// order to allow the deserializing the json back to struct in aggregate function in
/// aggregator.rs and create a new struct out of it and then serialize it back to json and pass
/// it to the template files.
