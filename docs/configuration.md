# Configuration

## Installed From Source

If you have built `websurfx` from source then the configuration file will be located under project directory (codebase) at `websurfx/`

> **Note**
> If you have built websurfx with unstable/rolling/edge branch then you can copy the configuration file from `websurfx/config.lua` located under project directory (codebase) to `~/.config/websurfx/` and make the changes there and rerun the websurfx server. _This is only available from unstable/rolling/edge version_.

## Installed From Package

If you have installed `websurfx` using the package manager of your Linux distro then the default configuration file will be located at `/etc/xdg/websurfx/`. You can copy the default config to `~/.config/websurfx/` and make the changes there and rerun the websurfx server.

Some of the configuration options provided in the file are stated below. These are subdivided into three categories:

## Server

- **port:** Port number on which server should be launched.
- **binding_ip_addr:** IP address on the which server should be launched.
- **production_use:** Whether to use production mode or not (in other words this option should be used if it is to be used to host it on the server to provide a service to a large number of users). If production_use is set to true. There will be a random delay before sending the request to the search engines, this is to prevent DDoSing the upstream search engines from a large number of simultaneous requests. This is newly added option and hence is only available in the **edge version**.
