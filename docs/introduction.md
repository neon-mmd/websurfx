# Introduction

A modern-looking, lightning-fast, privacy-respecting, secure [meta search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine) (pronounced as websurface or web-surface /wɛbˈsɜːrfəs/.) written in Rust. It provides a fast and secure search experience while respecting user privacy.

# Motivation

Most meta search engines tend to be slow, lack high level of customization and missing many features and all of them like security as they are written in unsafe languages like python, javascript, etc which tend to open a wide variety of vulnerabilities which can also sometimes pose a threat to privacy as sometimes this can be exploited and can be used to leveraged to leak out sensitive information which is never good. 

# Solution 

Websurfx is a project which seeks to provide privacy, security, speed and all the features which the user wants.
